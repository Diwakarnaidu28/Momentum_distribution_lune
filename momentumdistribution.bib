In a coupled mean-field and semiclassical scaling limit, we show that solutions of the many-body Schr\textasciidieresis odinger equation converge to solutions of a non-linear Hartree--Fock equation. The central ingredient of the proof are certain semiclassical trace norm estimates of commutators of the position and momentum operators with the one-particle density matrix of the solution of the Hartree--Fock equation. In a first step, we prove their validity for non-interacting initial data in a magnetic field by generalizing a result by Fournais and Mikkelsen [FM20b].

However, it suffers from some defects in predicting physical properties, making necessary a theory of quantum correlations. Recently, bosonization of many-body correlations has been rigorously justified as an upper bound on the correlation energy at high density with weak interactions. We review the bosonic approximation, deriving an effective Hamiltonian. We then show that for systems with Coulomb interaction this effective theory predicts collective excitations (plasmons) in accordance with the random phase approximation of Bohm and Pines, and with experimental observation.},

In the case of relativistic dispersion, we show convergence of the many-body evolution to the relativistic Hartree equation for all macroscopic times.

The value of A is found to be 0.0622, a result that could be deduced from previous work of Wigner, Macke, and Pines. An exact formula for the constant C is given here for the first time; earlier workers had made only approximate calculations of C. Further, it is shown how the next correction in rs can be computed. The method is based on summing the most highly divergent terms of the perturbation series under the integral sign to give a convergent result.

  abstract = {The momentum-distribution and pair-correlation functions of the electron gas at metallic densities are calculated by means of an expression of the ground-state energy derived in a previous paper. Numerical studies of the momentum distribution show that even at metallic densities most of the electrons are still inside the Fermi sphere and that the Fermi surface persists. The effect of the exchange processes at metallic densities is found to pull the electrons back inside the Fermi sphere and to increase the discontinuity at the Fermi surface, which is the opposite effect to that at high density. The behavior of the pair-correlation functions indicates that at short distances the present results overestimate the correlation of antiparallel spins but underestimate that of parallel spins. On the whole, there is considerable improvement over the corresponding results in the random-phase approximation.},

  abstract = {The electron gas at metallic densities is studied by means of a quadratic boson Hamiltonian which includes the direct and exchange processes among the electrons but neglects the scattering of electron-hole pairs. This Hamiltonian is further separated into two independent parts which describe the singlet and triplet states of the electron-hole pairs. These parts are diagonalized in an approximation in which the exchange interaction is treated on the average. A dielectric function for all momentum transfers is thereby obtained. The correlation energy is the sum of the ground-state energies of the singlet and triplet Hamiltonians. Its value, calculated for the metallic density range ({$rs$} =1 -6), is found to be about two-thirds of that in the random-phase approximation. It is consequently numerically smaller than most other estimates. The triplet contribution is very considerable. The triplet ground state is predicted to be unstable for {$rs$} {$>$}9.⁢4.},

It is shown that the volume of this surface in momentum space is unaffected by the interaction. The same analytic properties are shown to lead, by direct statistical mechanical arguments, to simple expressions for the low-temperature heat capacity, the spin paramagnetism, and the compressibility of the system. These expressions are very analogous to the corresponding expressions for noninteracting particles. Finally, it is shown how the whole formalism may be generalized when an external periodic potential is present (band case).},

With the momentum distribution, n(k), and with the kinetic (t) and potential (v) components of the total energy e = t + v, the respective steps are: (i) {$\Sigma$} (k, {$\omega$}) {$\rightarrow$} n(k) {$\rightarrow$} t, (ii) {$\Sigma$} (k, {$\omega$}) {$\rightarrow$} v, (iii) t + v = e{$\rightarrow$} S(q). How this general scheme works in detail is shown explicitly for the high-density limit (as an illustration). For this case the ring-diagram partial summation or random-phase approximation applies. In this way, the results of Macke (1950), Gell-Mann/Brueckner (1957), Daniel/Vosko (1960), Kulik (1961), and Kimball (1976) are summarized in a coherent manner. Besides, several identities were brought to the light, e.g. the Kimball function for S(q) proves to be identical with Macke's momentum transfer function I(q) for e.},
